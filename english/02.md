# Night Party of Cats

One night, someone placed a GemSTON box at the gathering place of the cats. The cats adorned themselves with the jewels from the box and enjoyed a party all night long. This party, filled with music and dance, became a big topic among the cats, and they spent a delightful time showing off their splendid appearances to each other.
