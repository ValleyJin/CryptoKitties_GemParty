# Story of Stray Cats

In a small village in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan, many stray cats live. These cats have different personalities and appearances, each with their own unique stories. Some cats talk about their experiences living in a bustling city, while others boast of their adventures across the sea. They share their dreams with each other, hoping to one day venture into a bigger world.
